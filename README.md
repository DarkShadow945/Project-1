# Earnings Hub

## Overview
Earnings Hub is a modern, responsive web application designed to showcase trusted online earning platforms, such as survey and task-based websites. The site features a visually engaging interface with parallax scrolling, 3D animations, and a filterable platform grid, providing users with an intuitive way to explore earning opportunities. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project emphasizes modularity, performance, and user experience.

## Features
- **Dynamic Platform Grid**: Displays a curated list of earning platforms with details like ratings, descriptions, earnings potential, and key features.
- **Category Filters**: Allows users to filter platforms by categories (e.g., Surveys & Tasks, Mobile Surveys) for easy navigation.
- **Parallax Scrolling**: Multi-layered parallax backgrounds create an immersive, depth-based visual effect.
- **3D Animations**: Smooth entrance animations and interactive 3D tilt effects on platform cards enhance engagement.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Anchor links provide a fluid navigation experience.
- **Performance Optimization**: Uses IntersectionObserver for lazy-loading animations and throttled scroll events for efficient parallax effects.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into separate files for maintainability and scalability:

earnings-hub/├── index.html         # Core HTML structure and content├── styles.css        # All CSS styles, including animations and responsive design├── script.js         # JavaScript logic for dynamic rendering, filters, and animations└── README.md         # Project documentation

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/earnings-hub.git


Navigate to the Project Directory:cd earnings-hub


Serve the Application:
Use a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code or python -m http.server 8000) to view the site in a browser.
Alternatively, open index.html directly in a browser (note: some features may require a server due to CORS restrictions).



Usage

Explore Platforms: Scroll to the "Trusted Earning Platforms" section and use the filter buttons to view platforms by category.
Interact with Cards: Hover over platform cards to see 3D tilt effects and click "Visit" links to access external platform websites.
Responsive Experience: Test the site on different devices to experience the responsive layout and animations.

Technologies Used

HTML5: Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.
CSS3: Advanced features like CSS Grid, 3D transforms, backdrop-filter, and keyframe animations.
JavaScript (Vanilla): Handles dynamic rendering, filtering, parallax scrolling, and IntersectionObserver-based animations.
No External Dependencies: Purely vanilla implementation for lightweight performance.

Potential Improvements

Accessibility:
Add ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-pressed for filter buttons, role="tablist" for filters).
Implement :focus styles for keyboard navigation.
Ensure WCAG-compliant color contrast for text elements.


Performance:
Add support for prefers-reduced-motion to disable animations for users with motion sensitivities.
Optimize backdrop-filter and parallax layers for low-end devices.
Implement lazy-loading for platform data via a JSON file and fetch().


Enhanced Features:
Add a search bar to filter platforms by name or keyword.
Introduce pagination or infinite scroll for scalability with a larger platform list.
Include a dark/light mode toggle for user customization.


SEO:
Add Open Graph meta tags for social sharing.
Implement structured data (e.g., JSON-LD for reviews) to enhance search engine visibility.


Touch Support: Replace mousemove tilt effects with touch-friendly interactions for mobile users.

Known Issues

The 3D tilt effect on platform cards (mousemove) is not active on touch devices. A touch-based alternative (e.g., tap-to-highlight) is recommended.
Heavy animations and backdrop-filter may cause performance issues on low-end devices. Consider fallbacks or reduced effects.
Some text elements (e.g., .stat-label) may have low contrast, requiring adjustment for accessibility.
